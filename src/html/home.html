      Computer science is the science that studies techniques, methodologies and computational tools,
      which automates processes and develops solutions based on the use of data processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not restricted to the study of the algorithms, their applications and implementation in the form of
      software,
      extrapolating to any and all knowledge based on the computer, which also involves the telecommunication,
      the database and the technological applications that allow to reach the data treatment of input and output,
      so that it becomes information.
      <p>
        <p>
          Computer Science also covers data modeling techniques and communication
          protocols, as well as principles that cover other area specializations.
